## About PomoDo

I've been following the Marketing Week / Coding Week philosophy for the past six months and have seen great user growth in my app [WorkSheet](https://worksheet.digital/) as a result of this split of my time. Combined with the popular Pomodoro method, I have found the perfect productivity method for me. Now I want to help others make these methods easily accessible.

For this I have combined the two approaches in the webapp PomoDo.

### Features

- Pomodoro Timer
- Codingweek / Marketingweek Reminder
- Todolist

### Built With

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/)

## Getting started

To get the project running locally on your machine you need to have the following development tools installed:

- Node.JS (we recommend v16)
- Yarn

1. Clone the project:

```
git clone git@github.com:maltesa/PomoDo.git && cd PomoDo
```

2. Install Node.JS packages via yarn. Don't have yarn? Use `npm install --global yarn`.

```
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

**You can now access the app on [https://localhost:5173](https://localhost:5173)**.
